# Bird_sound_classification_using_machine_learning
The automatic Bird Species Recognition will be more helpful for Researchers and Ornithologist who studies every aspect of birds. The research on various kinds of sounds from environments will be advantageous in the research of wildlife and their growth with respect to time. These kind of research and design of an automatic Bird Species Recognition could be very helpful. The bird species can be recognized by using bird’s audio recordings as an input to the models. Different models have used for classification of bird species. The spectrograms were constructed for each species from sound clip. The proposed technique uses feature extraction from spectrogram with respect to sounds using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) which forms Features Matrix These Features Matrix trained and also tested using models such as support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes etc. for efficient classification of bird species. The proposed method gives high accuracy using K-Nearest Neighbors for classification of bird species.
# DATASET 
This is a dataset of bird sound recordings, a specific subset gathered from the Xeno Canto collection to form a balanced dataset across 88 species commonly heard in the United Kingdom. It was originally compiled by Dan Stowell and shared on Archive.org.

The copyright in each audio file is owned by the user who donated the file to Xeno Canto. Please see "birdsong_metadata.tsv" for the full listing, which gives the authors' names and the CC licences applicable for each file. The audio files are encoded as .flac files.
