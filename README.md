# Bird_sound_classification_using_machine_learning-
The automatic Bird Species Recognition will be more helpful for Researchers and Ornithologist who studies every aspect of birds. The research on various kinds of sounds from environments will be advantageous in the research of wildlife and their growth with respect to time. These kind of research and design of an automatic Bird Species Recognition could be very helpful. The bird species can be recognized by using bird’s audio recordings as an input to the models. Different models have used for classification of bird species. The spectrograms were constructed for each species from sound clip. The proposed technique uses feature extraction from spectrogram with respect to sounds using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) which forms Features Matrix These Features Matrix trained and also tested using models such as support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes etc. for efficient classification of bird species. The proposed method gives high accuracy using K-Nearest Neighbors for classification of bird species.
